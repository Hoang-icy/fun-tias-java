Projects/fun programming problems I want to try.
The first one is a homework assignment from my Data Structure course: a 2-player zero-sum game against the computer. 
## Original Nim Game:
Starting with a pile of 13 coins
Each player take turn removing 1, 2 or 3 coins from the pile
Whoever takes the last coin loses.
## Modified Nim Game:
Starting with a pile of 2n+1 coins
Each player take turn removing either 1, 2 or 3 coins
Whoever ends up with an even number of coins win.
