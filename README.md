Fun programming problems/projects I want to try.
The first one is a homework assignment from my Data Structure course: a 2-player zero-sum game against the computer using Minimax algorithm. 

## NIM:

### Original Nim Game:
Starting with a pile of 13 coins

Each player take turn removing 1, 2 or 3 coins from the pile

Whoever takes the last coin loses.
### Modified Nim Game:
Starting with a pile of 2n+1 coins

Each player take turn removing either 1, 2 or 3 coins

Whoever ends up with an even number of coins win.
